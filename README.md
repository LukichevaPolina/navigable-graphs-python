# Navigable Graphs Python
I tried to change number of levels.
Plots for graphs with different ef values:
![avg_calc](avg_calc.png)
![recall](recall.png)

Values for graph with ef = 10, but recall calculated with values from 10 to 90:
![efs](res.png)


Method "count_connected_components" was added to class HNSW.
